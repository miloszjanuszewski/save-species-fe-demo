## Save Species demo app

This is a project which provides a frontend functionality for a Save Species app. It allows for viewing possible species for donation, listing user donations. Some actions are available only for authenticated user.

Currently it isn't communicating with the backend - it uses static mock data but in a format which matches the backend response.

It was creating using React with Typescript.
